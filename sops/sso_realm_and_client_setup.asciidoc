= Creating a new Keycloak Realm and Client

toc::[]

== Description

This SOP outlines the process of creating a new Keycloak Realm and Client within the Managed Application Services (MAS) staging data plane cluster.

NOTE: This SOP is explicitly targeting the `mas-sso` cluster within the staging environment. If this SOP is being used to target a different cluster, ensure that the `GitHub` IDP is configured on the cluster, and the correct Keycloak URL is used in the `Accessing Keycloak` section.

== Prerequisites
1. You are a member of the https://github.com/rh-mk-running-the-service[rh-mk-running-the-service] GitHub Organisation

== Execute/Resolution
=== Accessing Keycloak
1. Using the following URL, log into Keycloak via the `GitHub` IDP:
`https://keycloak-redhat-rhoam-user-sso.apps.mas-sso-stage.1gzl.s1.devshift.org`

=== Realm Creation
1. Hover your cursor over the top left corner drop-down menu in the Keycloak UI and click the `Add Realm` button
2. Select a name for your Realm and click the `Create` button

=== Client Creation
1. From the navigational menu to the left on the Keycloak UI, click `Clients`, then the `Create` button to the right of the client list
2. Select a `Client ID` value, and click `Save`
3. Create a new client by specifying a `Client ID`, and using the configuration values in the screenshot below, clicking the `Save` button once complete:

5. Click on the `Client Roles` drop-down menu and search for `realm management`
6. Select the `create-client` and `manage-clients` roles from `Available Roles` and add them as assigned roles, as displayed below:

== Troubleshooting
1. The error below will be displayed if an attempt is made to log in to the User-SSO Keycloak route without clearing the browser cookies for the cluster
